# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## What features do you have planned already?

You can find a list of things we've planned on our [roadmap](./roadmap "Roadmap"), but haven't come around to implement.

## Will there be a dark theme?

Of course! We have (almost) everything in place to support adding other themes, but for now we want to focus on adding features without worrying about how they look with different colors.

## Will there be a Discord integration of **arma.events**?

Yes! We plan to develop a sophisticated Discord bot that integrates with Discord's Scheduled Events and may even allow you to participate in events directly in Discord.

## Can I integrate **arma.events** data into my own forum / software?

We plan to add the ability to generate access tokens for our API, to allow you to integrate data from your **arma.events** community via our GraphQL API & webhooks into your own website, forum or discord bot.

## Will the use of **arma.events** cost money?

Although we are still a long way off (and therefore this is still subject to change), we are currently planning to offer a small monthly subscription for communities at a very low price (>$5) to cover our server costs. Since we probably hate the typical freemium offers as much as you do, this will only include features that are "nice-to-have" but absolutely no "must-haves", such as community-wide presets for events / slotlists / slotlist units, etc. Our goal for communities is that you do not pay for the subscription to be able to use **arma.events** just as well as communities that do pay, albeit with some missing quality-of-life features.

## Will **arma.events** be open source?

We are big supporters of open source, but **arma.events** won't be open sourced in the near future. Since one of our biggest goals is to encourage collaboration between communities, **arma.events** only really comes to shime when many communities are on the same platform. So we want to make sure that there is one platform and not one platform per community. That being said: There are many small open source projects and libraries that have sprung from the development of **arma.events**, and many more are likely to follow.
