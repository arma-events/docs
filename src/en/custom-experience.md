# Custom Experience

You can experience arma.events in various different ways depending on your **platform**, your preferred **theme** or your language and country settings for **localisation**.

## Platform

Despite the fact that all screenshots and videos on docs.arma.events are taken from a desktop environment, arma.events runs smoothly on mobile plattforms. Our app was even designed from ground up to support mobile platforms in all their variants including smartphones and tablets.

## Theme

No matter if you prefer light mode or dark mode. Both are supported by arma.events. Our app switches between modes automatically depending on your current setup. In **Windows 11** you will find the corresponding setting in your Windows settings under the heading **Color**. In **iOS** it's under Settings -> **Display & Brightness**. In **Android** it's under Settings --> **Display**.

## Localisation

Home matters. That's why we respect your prefered language, timezone and time format. Currently, we support **English** (of course) and **German** translations but everyone is welcome to contribute and help us translate arma.events to even more languages. See article [Contribution](./contribution) for more infos.

Every date and time displayed in our app is translated to your local timezone. That means if player A lives in Germany (**GMT+1**) and creates an event that starts at 8 p.m. it will be shown to player B as 9 p.m. who resides in Ukraine (**GMT+2**). To make things clear for the author we show the current timezone under every data & time selector and in event details. The format that is used to show date and time is also affected by your current language and country settings.
