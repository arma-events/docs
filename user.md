## Login with Steam SSO

It is very likely that every player that uses our platform has a Steam account. That is why we decided to link accounts on **arma.events** to the players Steam account. You simply need to login with your Steam account. That's all it takes. There is currently no way to create an account based on email address and password. Steam takes care of the login process. We can neither see your passord nor access your steam account.

### Avatar

Various image file formats are supported. You can zoom into your image with the **scroll wheel** of your mouse and move the image while holding your **left mouse button**. The avatar is always displayed in a circle. We store your image with a resolution of 256x256 pixels. If you use a very low-res image or zoom in a loEverything below that can lead to a blurry image.

### Name vs. Unique Username (Handle)

The regular name and the unique username (handle) are identical after first login. But they can be changed later individually.

Set your name to any string that is less or equal 50 unicode characters. The regular name is the one that is displayed on **arma.events** most of the time. You can share the same name with other users.

The unique username is a string with 32 or less web-safe characters that has to be unique on our platform. The availability of the unique username is checked every time you try to change it. The unique username is used mostly in URLs. In all other cases the regular name is displayed.

### Communities

Your user profile contains a list of all communities you are a member of. You can use this overview to quickly jump to the community or the leave the communities you no longer want to be part of by using the 3 dots context menu.

Keep in mind that the community will be deleted if you are the only/last member. If there are other members but you are the only administrator of this community then you need to transfer your admin rights to another member. See [communities](communities.md "Communities") for more information about community management.

### Sessions

Session management is a security feature. It lists every active browser session on your devices. Feel free to close/revoke all sessions you no longer need or all sessions at once. A revoked session means that you need to login again on that specific device/browser combination.

### Games and DLCs

In your profile you can setup which games you own. Currently supported are Arma 3 and Arma Reforger. Contact our [Support](support.md "Support") if you are interested in adding more games. If the game supports DLCs then please specify which DLCs you own.

Your owned DLCs will be matched against the DLC requirements that a mission creator has defined for a specific event. In case of a missing DLC you will get a warning.
